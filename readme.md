This is a script for porting all the Stripe data you care about into Xero as a bank statement, which means you can easily reconcile invoices, bank transfers, fees, etc. The script pulls directly from your Stripe account, with no messy intermediate steps.

# Configuration

## Configuration in Xero
Create a `Stripe` bank account in Xero. It should be a manual account. Also, create a new `bot` user, who will handle uploading bank statements.

## Environment Variables
Use these environment variables as configuration
    STRIPE_SECRET="api key from stripe"
    XERO_USER="username for xero"
    XERO_PASSWORD="password for xero"
    XERO_ACCT_ID="account id from Xero"
    BANK_NAME="the name of your transfer bank"
    STX_COUNT=50 #optional, but recommended

# Installation/Dependencies

Dependencies can be installed using bundler. Run `bundle install` in the repository root 
- `stripe` gem
- `mechanize` gem (We use this to import bank statements given Xero doesn't have an api for importing them.)

# Recommended tools
- `foreman` (recommended for easily running the script with environment variables)

# Usage

- Run `auto_import.sh` to automatically import your Stripe data into Xero.
- Or, just run the `stripe_to_xero.rb` script to generate `xero.csv` which you can upload manually.
- You can also specify a from date to `stripe_to_xero.rb` in the format of `stripe_to_xero.rb --date 03/03/2014`
- Reconcile away.

# Notes

We use `foreman` to easily set up environment variables. You might find it handy too.

Requires ruby 1.9.

# Changelog

v2 - Move from casper to mechanize, making it easier to deploy on Heroku.

v1 - Implements new refund calculation, adds better echoed text, uses Stripe's newish `expand` option to make 50 less API calls, and increase speed A LOT.
